# Ookla Triggers
A helping hand to our brothers and sisters immediately after an apocalypse.

When bills do not get paid, services shut off. All automatic-like with business logic tucked into the code saying, _deadbeats don't get shit_.

Fair enough.

What about when disaster strikes?

When bills _cannot_ get paid?

A megatsunami knocks out the US West coast. Space invaders invade from space. A super virus wipes out 96% of humanity.

When bills cannot get paid, _everyone automatically transforms into a deadbeat_.

Services universally and permanently suspend as humanity most needs the support.

Why not a few triggers to let services run free indefinitely in case of existential disaster?

Let your brothers and sisters have water and internet and [SeeSo](https://www.seeso.com/) and electricity and whatever while stitching society back together. Put a pause in the old profit margin while friends and neighbors fend off [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) or demons.

If you're still alive, CEO, because you rode out the chaos of the virus through lucky genetics or evaded the killzone of the [supervolcano](https://americaninfomaps.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/yellowstone-super-volcano-projected-eruption-maps-geology-survival-casualty-maps/) because you helicoptered to Vancouver Island you can reinstate the old policies later.

Or leverage your newfound control and goodwill into your very own city state! A proto-empire for your offspring. [note to self: future post]

###### Trigger 1: No Internet at All
Your powerplant can't talk to the internet for a week?

Maybe it's not our fault, hoser. Maybe it's [really foggy outside](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/).

###### Trigger 2: Mass Non-Payment Outage
Weird, 80% of our customer base didn't pay. Wonder if the meteor which wiped out most of state had anything to do with it.

###### Trigger 3: A Super Secret Safeword Humanity can Memorize
You work at the CDC or are a demonologist? In case of emergency text `seriouslyImNotAnAddict!` to `0118 999 881 999 119 7253` [(They're your emergency services.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8GtuPdrUQ)

What did I miss?

I'm not sure what drives the old classics' -- power, gas, water -- code bases . COBOL on an AS400? (We can make a call for these platforms.)

For modern services who use NodeJS -- Netflix, we'll want those Bill Burr specials for belly laughs and _Planet of the Apes_ movies for reference -- here's a kernel:
